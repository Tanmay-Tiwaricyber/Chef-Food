                On your main website, you should focus on essential information <br> like address, phone number, reservations & online ordering button, <br> and so on. People who visit your website because they want to dine <br> with you or place an order will seldom want to read a long story <br> about how you build the restaurant from the ground up. Save those <br> kinds of stories for your blog. <br> <br>
    A blog is a perfect place for stories because there will always be <br> people who want to learn more about their favorite restaurant. They <br> will feel more connected to it if they can put a face to the name. <br> <br>
    That said, as a restaurant owner, write posts about your journey to <br> success, what inspired you to open the restaurant, how you opened it, <br> the challenges you faced along the way, the things youâ€™ve learned, etc. <br> If you have old photos to attach to the blog posts, even better. <br><br>
